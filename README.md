# Internship Web Scraping Projects

This repository contains all the Python and Jupyter Notebook files I created during my internship, focused on web scraping and basic data extraction.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents:
- Web scraping assignments using `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas`
- Data extraction and storage in CSV files
- Parsing HTML and handling pagination

## ðŸ§  Learning Outcome:
These tasks helped me build a strong understanding of:
- How websites serve content
- How to automate data collection
- Real-world applications of Python scripting

## âš¡ Current Update:
I'm now focused on SQL, backend development, and analytics skills.  
This repo is a part of my early data journey.
